                                  <b>Review Modules 1 - 6: </b><strong>Try to review 1 module per day.</strong> Start with the module which you have identified as being the one you need to focus your attention on the most and work towards reviewing the modules from those you need to master to those in which you know you already have a sound knowledge. If you are really strong in any specific module, donât spend too much time reviewing it so that you can rather spend more time reviewing the modules that you are weaker in. You want to try and become an expert on all the study material within each module. Read the worksheets, listen to the audio recordings, watch the videos, and focus on the highlighted information. You can cross reference information from other resources, but it is recommended that you follow your schedule, and you stay on the listed topics. This is also a good time to make flash cards of the information you have difficulty understanding. To help you understand a topic,
                                  come up with 2 or 3 examples of interventions for each diagnoses. As 50% of the exam is intervention based, we always want to keep that in mind. If you come across information you know, try not to study that information rather focus on what you don't know so that you can make your study time effective and efficient. Your time is very valuable. Once you review the material in a specific module and you feel that you have a strong grasp of the information, take the timed module exam. Do not waste time taking timed exams more than once. Instead, review only the questions you answered incorrectly and the topics you do not yet fully understand. This is a very important strategy you can use during this studying process. To further help you comprehend the information, try to figure out why one answer is correct, and the other answers are incorrect. Also come up with scenarios in which the wrong answers would be correct. If you score under 75% on a timed module
                                  exam, you should consider using private tutoring to review the answers that you got wrong as well as to discuss complex concepts that you are still confused about.

In order to get the most benefit from our program, we highly recommend combining our web course with a weekly or bi-weekly private tutoring session, until you take your exam. This will help prepare you enormously! Remember, this is just a proposal and we can easily modify your study plan to adjust to your lifestyle depending on whether you have kids, work obligations, or financial hardships. I suggest studying 2 modules per week until you take the exam. It is recommended that you study 4 - 7 hours per day and take at least a half day off. A breakdown of the modules are below:</p>

                                  <p><b>START</b> by taking the Personality Assessment Test to determine what type of study style suits you best. You may be either a visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learner and it is incredibly helpful to understand the way you learn in order to maximize your studying efforts. It takes less than 5 minutes to complete this quiz.</p>
                                  <p><b>NEXT:</b>Â Take either the 200 question or 100 question Assessment Test to see what scores you get in all topics and domains. You do not need to take both exams. If you have the time, we highly recommend you take the timed 200 question test which gives you 4 hours to complete, just like in the actual exam. If you are pressed for time and want a quicker snapshot, take the 100 question test which gives you 2 hours to complete. This obviously will not give you as good a picture as the full 4 hour exam which will test your stamina better, but it will still give you a good idea on the areas you need to work on most.</p>
                                  <p><b>LAST: </b>Â After taking this Assessment Test , it is recommended that you review your results according to the category overview of the assessment. By using this approach, you will be able to see in which domains you scored the strongest and weakest. This will help guide you in setting up an optimal study plan, by helping you identify which topics you need to focus more on.</p>

                                <p>During the first three weeks, it is recommended you go through modules 1 - 6. Begin studying the module in which you scored the lowest and work backwards to the module in which you scored the highest. This approach will help you uncover your blind spots which will build your self confidence. During those first 3 weeks, it is recommended that you follow a schedule similar to the one below. I suggest covering 2 modules over a week which means you will be studying one module every three or four days for the next three weeks. To get the most from the learning material in each module, I suggest going through each of the 6 modules with the following system:</p>

                                <p><b>Day 1 (Assess)</b> - Begin with your weakest module, based on your assessment test. It is best to begin each module with the module assessment quiz (untimed quiz) so that you know where to best focus your study efforts when reviewing the study material in that module. You do not need to study everything. Focus first on the areas where you scored the weakest. This will help prevent you from feeling overwhelmed, something which so many students complain about when using other study materials. Furthermore, we have highlighted the material for you so that we can help you focus on what is most important.</p>
                                <p><b>Days 1-2 (Address)</b></p>
                                <p>After taking the assessment quiz in that specific module and reviewing your strengths and weakness analysis, focus on studying the charts, listen to the audio recordings, watch the videos, and take note of the highlighted information! You can cross reference information from other resources, but it is recommended that you stay on the topics listed and you stay on schedule. This is also a good time to make flash cards of the information you are having difficulty understanding and to come up with 2 or 3 examples of interventions for each diagnoses. 50% of the exam is intervention based so we always want to keep that in mind. If you come across information you know, try not to study that information. Focus on what you don't know so that you can make sure you use your study time effectively and efficiently. Your time is very valuable and you do not want to fatigue yourself studying material you already know well.</p>
                                <p><b>Day 3 (Test)</b></p>
                                <p>Take the timed quiz only on the topics which are covered in the module you are working through. You want to achieve a score of 75% or better. You should also be honest with yourself on the answers you correctly guessed. Guessing does not mean you understand the material. In fact, we recommend not guessing on our practice quizzes so that you really get a true reflection of your abilities and where you stand. Review only the questions you got wrong and the topics you find confusing and are having difficulty understanding. This is the most important day of the week! Try to figure out why one answer is correct and why the other answers are incorrect. Also, come up with scenarios when the wrong answers would be correct.</p>
                                <p><b>Day 4 (Assess) </b></p>
                                <p>Go to your second weakest module from your assessment test. - Begin with the module assessment quiz (untimed quiz) so that you know where to best focus your study efforts when reviewing the study material in that module.

                                <p>After taking the assessment quiz in that module and reviewing your strengths and weakness analysis, focus on studying the charts, listen to the audio recordings, watch the videos, and take note of the highlighted information! You can cross reference information from other resources, but it is recommended that you stay on the topics listed and you stay on schedule. This is also a good time to make flash cards of difficult information and to come up with 2 or 3 examples of interventions for each diagnoses. 50% of the exam is intervention based so we always want to keep that in mind.

                                <p>Ideally, you would work with a private tutor on day 6 or day 7 of each week to go through the 2 modules which you reviewed. The tutor will make sure that you know all the necessary information and that you are ready to proceed to the next module. Remember to make a document of any questions you would like to review or topics you'd like to go over. This will let the tutor know what to focus on and how to help you increase your critical thinking when it comes to breaking questions down, especially when two answer choices seem correct. We strongly suggest that you take advantage of private tutoring if you scored 75% or below on the timed exam for the given module. After your private tutoring session, you might want to take a break from studying. You should also take advantage of the free group tutoring sessions that we offer each week to all our active members. Attending these sessions will reinforce your understanding of complex material, increase your</p>
                                <p>critical thinking, give you a better understanding of interventions and teach you how to break down questions especially when two answer choices seem correct.</p>

I suggest studying 1 module per week until you take the exam.. It is recommended that you study 4 - 7 hours per day and take one day off. A breakdown of the material covered in the modules is below:</p>

                                  <p><b>START</b> by taking the Personality Assessment Test to determine what type of study style suits you best. You may be either a visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learner and it is incredibly helpful to understand the way you learn in order to maximize your studying efforts. It takes less than 5 minutes to complete this quiz.</p>
                                  <p><b>NEXT:</b> Take either the 200 question or 100 question assessment test to see what scores you get in all topics and domains. You should not take both exams. If you have the time, we highly recommend you take the timed 200 question test which gives you 4 hours to complete just like in the actual exam. If you are pressed for time and want a quicker snapshot, take the 100 question test which gives you 2 hours to complete. This obviously will not give you as good a picture as the full 4 hour exam which will test your stamina better, but it will still give you a good idea on the areas you need to work on most.</p>
                                  <p><b>LAST: </b>After taking this Assessment Test , it is recommended that you review your results according to the category overview of the assessment. By using this approach, you will be able to see in which domains you scored the strongest and weakest. This will help guide you in setting up an optimal study plan, by helping you identify which topics you need to focus more on.</p>

                                  <p>During the first six weeks, you should go through modules 1 - 6. Begin studying the module in which you scored the lowest and work backwards to the module in which you scored the best. This approach will help you uncover your blind spots and build your confidence. During those first 3 weeks, it is recommended that you follow a schedule similar to the one below. I suggest spending 1 week on each module and therefore you will be studying the 6 modules over the next six weeks. To get the most from the learning material in each module, I suggest going through each of the 6 modules with the following system:</p>
                                  <p>
                                    <div class="bar-IMG_h"><img src="https://passtheot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/step-header-banner1.png" /></div>
                                  </p>
                                  <p><b>Day 1 (Assess)</b></p>
                                  <p>It is best to begin each module with the module assessment quiz (untimed quiz) so that you know where to best focus your study efforts when reviewing the study material in that module. You do not need to study everything. Focus first on the areas where you were weakest. This will help you from feeling overwhelmed, something which so many students have complained about after using other study materials. Furthermore, we have highlighted the material for you so that we can help you focus on what is most important.</p>
                                  <p><b>Days 1-3 (Address)</b></p>
                                  <p>After taking the assessment quiz in that module and reviewing your strengths and weakness analysis, focus on studying the charts, listen to the audio recordings, watch the videos, and focus on the highlighted information! You can cross reference information from other resources, but it is recommended that you stay on the topics listed and you stay on schedule. This is also a good time to make flash cards of information you are having difficulty understanding and to come up with 2 or 3 examples of interventions for each diagnoses. 50% of the exam is intervention based so we always want to keep that in mind. If you come across information you know, try not to study that information. Focus on what you don't know so that you can make your study time effective and efficient. Your time is very valuable.</p>
                                  <p><b>Day 4 (Test)</b></p>
                                  <p>Take the timed quiz only on the topics which are covered in the module you are working through. You want to achieve a score of 75% or better. You should also be honest with yourself on answers where you correctly guessed the right answer. Guessing does not mean you understand the material In fact, we recommend not guessing on our practice quizzes so that you will get a true reflection of your abilities and understand where you stand</p>
                                  <p><b>Day 5 (Test)</b></p>
                                  <p>Review only the questions you got wrong and the topics you are confused about. This is the most important day of the week! Try to figure out why one answer is correct and the other answers are incorrect. Also, come up with scenarios when the wrong answers would be correct.</p>
                                  <p><b>Day 6 (Master)</b></p>
                                  <p>Ideally, you would work with a private tutor on day six of each week to go through the module which you recently reviewed. If you have four tutoring sessions or less, you could use a tutor after covering every 2 modules. Your private tutor will make sure that you know all the necessary information and that you are ready to move on to the next module. Remember to make a document of any questions you would like to review or topics you'd like to go over. This will let the tutor know what to focus on and how to help you increase your critical thinking when it comes to breaking questions down, especially when two answer choices seem correct. We strongly suggest that you take advantage of our private tutoring if you scored 75% or below on the timed exam for the given module. We also highly recommend that you take advantage of the free group tutoring sessions that we offer each week to all our active members. Attending these sessions will reinforce your</p>
                                  <p>understanding of complex material, increase your critical thinking, give you a better understanding of interventions and teach you how to break down questions especially when two answer choices seem correct</p>
                                  <p><b>Day 7:</b> Break</p>
                                  <p><b>Day 8:</b> You will start with your second weakest module, following the same procedure as the first module which you just completed. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions?</p>

                                  <p>It is best to begin each module with the module assessment quiz (untimed quiz) so that you know where to best focus your study efforts when reviewing the study material in that module. You do not need to study everything. Focus first on the areas where you were weakest. This will help you from feeling overwhelmed, something which so many students have complained about after using other study materials. Furthermore, we have highlighted the material for you so that we can help you focus on what is most important.</p>

                                  <p>After taking the assessment quiz in that module and reviewing your strengths and weakness analysis, focus on studying the charts, listen to the audio recordings, watch the videos, and focus on the highlighted information! You can cross reference information from other resources, but it is recommended that you stay on the topics listed and you stay on schedule. This is also a good time to make flash cards of information you are having difficulty understanding and to come up with 2 or 3 examples of interventions for each diagnoses. 50% of the exam is intervention based so we always want to keep that in mind. If you come across information you know, try not to study that information. Focus on what you don't know so that you can make your study time effective and efficient. Your time is very valuable.</p>
                                  <p><b>Week 3 (Test)</b></p>
                                  <p>Take the timed quiz only on the topics which are covered in the module you are working through. You want to achieve a score of 75% or better. You should also be honest with yourself on answers where you correctly guessed the right answer. Guessing does not mean you understand the material In fact, we recommend not guessing on our practice quizzes so that you will get a true reflection of your abilities and understand where you stand</p>
                                  <p><b>Week 3 (Test)</b> . Review only the questions you got wrong and the topics you are confused about. This is the most important day of the week! Try to figure out why one answer is correct and the other answers are incorrect. Also, come up with scenarios when the wrong answers would be correct.</p>
                                  <p><b>Week 3 (Master)</b>Â We highly recommend that you take advantage of the free group tutoring sessions that we offer each week to all our active members.

This will help prevent you from feeling overwhelmed, something which so many students complain about when using other study materials. Furthermore, we have highlighted the material for you so that we can help you focus on what is most important.</p>
                                  <p><b>Days 1-2 (Address)</b></p>
                                  <p>After taking the assessment quiz in that specific module and reviewing your strengths and weakness analysis, focus on studying the charts, listen to the audio recordings, watch the videos, and take note of the highlighted information! You can cross reference information from other resources, but it is recommended that you stay on the topics listed and you stay on schedule. This is also a good time to make flash cards of the information you are having difficulty understanding and to come up with 2 or 3 examples of interventions for each diagnoses. 50% of the exam is intervention based so we always want to keep that in mind. If you come across information you know, try not to study that information. Focus on what you don't know so that you can make sure you use your study time effectively and efficiently. Your time is very valuable and you do not want to fatigue yourself studying material you already know well.</p>
                                  <p><b>Day 3 (Test)</b></p>
                                  <p>Take the timed quiz only on the topics which are covered in the module you are working through. You want to achieve a score of 75% or better. You should also be honest with yourself on the answers you correctly guessed. Guessing does not mean you understand the material. In fact, we recommend not guessing on our practice quizzes so that you really get a true reflection of your abilities and where you stand. Review only the questions you got wrong and the topics you find confusing and are having difficulty understanding. This is the most important day of the week! Try to figure out why one answer is correct and why the other answers are incorrect. Also, come up with scenarios when the wrong answers would be correct.</p>

                                  <p>Ideally, you would work with a private tutor on day 6 or day 7 of each week to go through the 2 modules which you reviewed. The tutor will make sure that you know all the necessary information and that you are ready to proceed to the next module. Remember to make a document of any questions you would like to review or topics you'd like to go over. This will let the tutor know what to focus on and how to help you increase your critical thinking when it comes to breaking questions down, especially when two answer choices seem correct. We strongly suggest that you take advantage of private tutoring if you scored 75% or below on the timed exam for the given module. After your private tutoring session, you might want to take a break from studying. You should also take advantage of the free group tutoring sessions that we offer each week to all our active members. Attending these sessions will reinforce your understanding of complex material, increase your</p>
                                  <p>critical thinking, give you a better understanding of interventions and teach you how to break down questions especially when two answer choices seem correct.</p>

If you are really strong in any specific module, donât spend too much time reviewing it so that you can rather spend more time reviewing the modules that you are weaker in.</p>

This is also a good time to make flash cards of the information you have difficulty understanding. To help you understand a topic, come up with 2 or 3 examples of interventions for each diagnoses. As 50% of the exam is intervention based, we always want to keep that in mind.

To further help you comprehend the information, try to figure out why one answer is correct, and the other answers are incorrect. Also come up with scenarios in which the wrong answers would be correct.
